Usage.1=Usage:\n\nThe application accepts 3 parameters (the latter two beeing optional):\n\t1. A path to a gamefile\n\t2. Rules for Ant turning\n\t3. The speedup-factor\n\n----\n
Usage.2=1. The Gamefile:\n\tIt cotains one line per row (all rows must be of equal length) and one character for every field in that row.\n
Usage.3=\tA field can be different things:\n\ta) It can be blocked (marked by an asterisk)\n\tb) It can contain an Ant:\n

Usage.9=\tThe parameter consists of the word \"rule=\" and a sequence of degrees split by a hyphen.\n\tThere HAS to be a rule for every color\n\n----\n
Usage.10=3. The speedup-factor:\n\tIt consists of the word \"speedup=\" and an integer larger or equal to 1.\n
